# Causal-Inference

## Introduciton

Modern accounting research is very much about empirical research and causal inference is an integral part of empirical research, so I am learning about causal inference.

This repository is my notes on studying causal inference, which involves notes on relevant knowledge and a reproduction of some classic papers.

This study note contains the mainstream research methods nowadays, including DID, SCM, SDID, and RDD.
