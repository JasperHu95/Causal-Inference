# Causal-Inference

## Introduciton

Modern accounting research is very much about empirical research and causal inference is an integral part of empirical research, so I am learning about causal inference.

This repository is my notes on studying causal inference, which involves notes on relevant knowledge and a reproduction of some classic papers.

This study note contains the mainstream research methods nowadays, including DID, SCM, SDID, and RDD.

Chapter 1 is on statistical inference and causal identification and covers basic statistical concepts, characteristics of statistical inference, law of large numbers and central limit theorem, self-help method, statistical hypothesis testing, data types, panel data, credibility revolution in causal identification, concepts of causal effects and counterfactuals, methods of estimating causal effects, endogeneity problems and their solutions, policy analysis, and related literature.

Chapter 2 DiD Method

Chapter 2 introduces the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method, focusing on the classic two-way fixed effects model and its application in causal inference. It explains the key assumptions of DiD, such as the parallel trend assumption, and provides a regression model for parameter estimation. The document also discusses selection bias and solutions like weighting methods, and presents several application cases of DiD in various research contexts.
